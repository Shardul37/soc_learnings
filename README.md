# soc_learnings
Our 1st week started by learning the basics of python. I already knew python so I just brushed up the syntaxes. And we were suppose to complete (3+4) courses from coursera. I have finished just my 1st and 2nd course in which I learnt about implementing regression model, classification algorithms, neural network etc.
